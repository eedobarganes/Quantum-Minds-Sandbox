Multi-Agent Intentional-Operator Sandbox
Real-time playground for exploring collective alignment in quantum-style agents.

What It Is

This project turns two theoretical ideas,  "The Mind as Quantum-Consciousness Projection in Hilbert Space " and " The Intentional Operator" into an executable simulation. Each on-screen circle is an open quantum system whose internal state drifts under noise but is periodically “kicked” toward a shared goal by an intentional pulse. Quantum similarity between agents is re-expressed as physical attraction, so alignment in Hilbert space becomes visible motion in a 2-D arena.

Key Features:
- Fully contained Python ≥ 3.11 script (≈250 LOC, no external engine)
- Open quantum dynamics via Lindblad-style update
- Adjustable focus parameter controlling intentional strength
- Dynamic goal estimation chosen from the most coherent agent
- Live Pygame visualisation
- Colour (blue→orange) = coherence with goal
- Radius = coherence magnitude
- Arrows = velocity vectors

Keyboard controls
SPACE pause / resume · ↑/↓ change focus · r reset · q/ESC quit
